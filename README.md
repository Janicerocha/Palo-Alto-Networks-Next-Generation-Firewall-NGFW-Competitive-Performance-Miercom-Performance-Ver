I was the lead engineer for this project which focused on competitive validation testing with Palo Alto NGFWs against Fortigate and Cisco.

Business networks are a hybrid of local, remote and mobile networks that each introduce their own range of threats and vulnerabilities. Administrators need to ensure the organization, and all its users, can safely access critical resources without affecting productivity, speed or security. Palo Alto Networks engaged Miercom to perform independent validation testing of PA-5450 NGFW to demonstrate how deploying its security services boosts protection, with lower performance degradation, resulting in a stronger security posture at a lower total cost of ownership.
